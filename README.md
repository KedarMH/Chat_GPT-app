# Chat_GPT-clone app

ChatGPT is a new Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology developed by OpenAI.

In this I made an effort to create the same ChatGPT app by using OpenAI API with React and Node.js.

Built this clone of an AI app using React.js with an elegant user interface that resembles the
ChatGPT app, communication with advanced GPT3 model API, and most importantly, the ability
to ask the AI for help regarding JavaScript, React, or any other programming language, giving it
code and translating it to another programming language, and much more.
